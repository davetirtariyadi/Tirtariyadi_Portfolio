In this post, I analyze data on the oldest centenarians in the world! The main dataset was produced by frankiethull and can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-05-30). The dataset contains the oldest 100 known verified male and female centenarians.

```{r}
#| label: load-data-pkgs
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(skimr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

centenarians <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-30/centenarians.csv')

```

Let's skim the dataset first.

```{r}
#| label: skim-data
#| echo: false

skim(centenarians)
```

We see that there are eight variables in the dataset, including `place_of_death_or_residence`, `gender`, and `birth_date`.

Cool thing: the average age of the 100 oldest male and female centenarians is **114 years old**!

# Exploratory data analysis

## Location

Let's first take a look at where the 100 oldest male and female centenarians come from.

```{r}
#| label: top-ten-country
#| echo: false

top_ten_country <- centenarians %>% 
  group_by(place_of_death_or_residence) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  rename(Country = place_of_death_or_residence, Count = n)

kable(top_ten_country,
      align = "l",
      caption = "Top Ten Countries with the Highest Number of Centenarians") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down", "HOLD_position"))
```

We see that the **United States** and **Japan** dominate the list of countries, accounting for more than half of the entire dataset of 200 centenarians! How about if we analyze on the continent-level?

```{r}
#| label: continent-rank
#| echo: false

library(countrycode)
clean_continent <- centenarians %>% 
  mutate(
    place_of_death_or_residence = case_when(
      place_of_death_or_residence == "France (French Guiana)" ~ "France",
      place_of_death_or_residence == "France (Saint Barth√©lemy)" ~ "France",
      TRUE ~ place_of_death_or_residence
    )
  )

clean_continent <- clean_continent %>% 
  mutate(
    continent = 
      countrycode(
        clean_continent$place_of_death_or_residence, 
        origin = "country.name", 
        destination = "continent")
  )

clean_continent %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = fct_rev(fct_infreq(continent)))) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "pink2") +
  labs(
    title = 
      "Continent Distribution of Centenarian Place of Death or Residence",
    subtitle = "Most centenarians are from the Americas, Asia or Europe",
    y = "",
    x = ""
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Let's take a closer look at centenarians from the United States and Japan. What does the gender distribution look like?

```{r}
#| label: gender-us-japan
#| echo: false

us_japan <- centenarians %>% 
  filter(place_of_death_or_residence %in% c("United States", "Japan")) %>% 
  group_by(place_of_death_or_residence, gender) %>% 
  count()

pivot_us_japan <- us_japan %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = gender, values_from = n) %>% 
  rename(
    Country = place_of_death_or_residence, 
    Female = female, Male = male)

kable(pivot_us_japan,
      align = "l",
      caption = "Gender Distribution among Centenarians in the United States and Japan") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down", "HOLD_position"))
```

We see that there is an almost equal split between male and female in Japan and the United States.

## Birth date

Are centenarians more likely to be born on a certain month?

```{r}
#| label: month-dist
#| echo: false

birth_month <- centenarians %>% 
  select(name, birth_date) %>% 
  mutate(
    birth_month = factor(month.name[month(birth_date)], levels = month.name)
  )

birth_month %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = birth_month)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "pink2") +
  labs(
    x = "Month of birth",
    y = "",
    title = "Distribution of Centenarians by Birth Month"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

There's no clear winner here, but the top two months are **May** and **August**.

Were centenarians who were born earlier in history more like to reach an older age?

```{r}
#| label: age-vs-birth-date
#| echo: false

centenarians %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = birth_date, y = age, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Age",
    color = "Gender",
    title = "Age Distribution of Centenarians by Gender Over Time"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = function(x) str_to_title(x))
```

There does not seem to be a clear trend between age and birth date, but the plot above demonstrates that the age of female centenarians are generally greater than male centenarians. So, maybe it is true that men's lives are shorter than women's!
